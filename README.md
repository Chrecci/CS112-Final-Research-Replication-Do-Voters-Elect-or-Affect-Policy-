# CS112-Final-Research-Replication-Do-Voters-Elect-or-Affect-Policy-

This is the code following our final project. We first replicate Figure 1 in the original paper "Do Voters Affect or Elect Policies? Evidence from the U. S. House" by Lee, Moretti, & Butler (2004). Then in an effort to improve upon their findings we carry out an extension upon this figure for more robust results.

You can find the original paper by Lee et. al. here: https://eml.berkeley.edu/~moretti/final.pdf

Original code and data can be found here: https://eml.berkeley.edu/~moretti/data3.html

For our work we've translated the original STATA code into R

Original data can be found in directory "gz_data_LMB"
